    Welcome to Space Station 14! We hope you enjoy the game, and this entry will serve to brief you on the basics of play.

#Basic controls
    There's a handful primary interactions in SS14, ordered by importance:

    ›  [color=#a4885c]Left click[/color] to pick up items and activate objects like buttons or computers. You can also press [color=#a4885c]alt[/color] while doing this to trigger alternate interactions for some objects.
    ›  You can also quickly activate items you're holding by pressing [color=#a4885c]Z[/color] and [color=#a4885c]alt-Z[/color] respectively.
    ›  [color=#a4885c]Right click[/color] to open the context menu. You can then either left click an entry just like you would in the world, or right click it again to open the verb menu, which gives you more complex ways to interact with an object.
    ›  You can [color=#a4885c]shift-left click[/color] objects to examine them, and get their name and a detailed (though often humorous) description.

    You can quickly try out these controls with the monkey below, and at any point in this guidebook if you're shown an entity, [color=#a4885c]shift-left click to examine will always work[/color]:

#Inventory
    In order to move items around in your inventory and between containers, you can click the item (or item name) to move it to your active hand, and then click the spot you want it to go (either a slot in your HUD, or the container).
