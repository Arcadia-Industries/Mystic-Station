# Diagnosis
This section covers the many ways that you can diagnose a patient with or without a health analyzer.

## The Health Analyzer
By far, the easiest way to diagnose a patient is to scan them with a health analyzer or a doctor's PDA.

These tools will give you a simple readout that lists the amount of each [color=red]damage[/color] type a patient has taken.  Additionally, this tool will tell you if your patient has one or more [color=YellowGreen]diseases[/color].

To use these tools, you simply hold it in your hand and click on the patient.

The PDA will leave the diagnosis on-screen for you when you put it back in your ID slot, but the health analyzer must remain in hand to achieve the same effect.

## Visual Diagnostics
For physical injuries you can get a good idea of your patients condition by inspecting their health.  

You can inspect the health of your patient by right clicking on them, selecting Examine, and then selecting Health.
You will see messages like:

<Box>[color=red]They have minor contusions across their body.[/color]</Box>
<Box>[color=crimson]They are profusely bleeding![/color]</Box>
<Box>[color=bisque]They look pale.[/color]</Box>

Details on these messages and how to decode them can be found in the Damage Types section.

## Medical HUD

The medical HUD is [color=red]not[/color] yet fully implemented, but when it is, it should provide at-a-glance diagnostic information about the patient's overall health.  

Right now it is just a cosmetic item.
