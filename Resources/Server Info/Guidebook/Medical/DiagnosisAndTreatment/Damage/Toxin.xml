# Toxin

[color=Gold]Toxin[/color]:

</Box>
Toxin damage is the group of damage your patients take from injesting poisons, overdosing, and being exposed to radioactive materials.

## Treatment
All of the cures to toxin damage target the [color=DeepSkyBlue]damage types[/color], not the entire [color=Gold]damage group[/color] .  This means that radiation and poison will have completely different treatments.

- [color=DeepSkyBlue]Poison[/color]

Poison is most commonly treated by a chemical called [color=#6b36ff]Dylovene[/color].  Much stronger alternatives include [color=#4248b8]Stellibinin[/color] and [color=#911955]Ultravasculine[/color]. There is also an anti-poison medical injector, though these are very rare.

- [color=DeepSkyBlue]Radiation[/color]

Radiation is most commonly treated by a chemical called [color=#4cb580]Hyronalin[/color], which is a dreadful medicine because it is weak and causes vomiting. A many times more powerful alternative is [color=#bd5902]Arithrazine[/color]; it has the side effect of causing minor brute damage.
