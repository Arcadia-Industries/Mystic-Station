  They handle everything from [color=#a4885c]buying and selling[/color] supplies to
  [color=#a4885c]mining resources[/color] in space, and [color=#a4885c]take orders[/color] from the crew.
  \n\n
  Occasionally, they also found [color=#a4885c]The Great Cargonia[/color], an independant nation, and then
  [color=#a4885c]build their own ship[/color] and fly off into space.
