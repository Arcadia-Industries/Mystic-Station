# Gravitational Singularity Engine

The Gravitational Singularity Engine can yield infinite power, with no fueling required. It can also destroy the whole station with equal ease. It uses a Particle Accelerator to fire high energy particles at a Singularity Generator to form a singularity. The singularity then pulses radiation which is absorbed by Radiation Collectors.


## Setting it up

The Gravitational Singularity Engine requires 4 subsystems to work properly:

### Gravitational singularity generator
<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SingularityGenerator"/>
</Box>
The generator should be anchored at the center of the containment area since this is where the singularity will appear at.

### Containment field generators and emitters
<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Emitter"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ContainmentFieldGenerator"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ContainmentField"/>
</Box>
The emitters connect to MV cables and fire lasers as long as they have power and are turned on.
Fire emitters at containment field generators to activate them.
If two containment field generators are active, in range and in the same cardinal axis, a containment field will appear.
The containment field will repell the singularity, keeping it from escaping, and yield a little bit of power every time anything bounces off of them. 
Emitter lasers and containment fields can cause damage, avoid touching them when active.

### Radition collectors
<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RadiationCollector"/>
</Box>
They connect to HV cables and generate power from nearby radiation sources when turned on.

### Particle accelerator


<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ParticleAcceleratorEmitterLeft"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ParticleAcceleratorEmitterCenter"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ParticleAcceleratorEmitterRight"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ParticleAcceleratorControlBox"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ParticleAcceleratorEndCap"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ParticleAcceleratorFuelChamber"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ParticleAcceleratorPowerBox"/>
</Box>



The Particle Accelerator (PA) is a multi-tile structure that activates a gravitational singularity generator with the particles it generates. Its emitters should always face the gravitational singularity generator.
Some stations already have an unfinished PA. To complete, first make sure there is HV cable beneath the PA, anchor all parts, then add LV cable to each part.

</Box>
Then use a screwdriver to screw back the panels.
Scan parts using the PA control computer to check if it's operational. If it shows up as incomplete, examine for what's missing.

## Turing on the Gravitational Singularity Engine

[color=#a4885c]Do not[/color] turn the PA on unless all other subsystems are working properly.

Turn power on using the PA control computer. Set strength to an appropiate level.

The PA will start firing particles towards the Gravitational singularity generator. 

A singularity will soon appear.

##Safety
Singularity emits radiation around it, always keep a distance from it. Consider getting gear that provides shielding against radiation beforehand. Seek medical attention if experiencing health issues.

If a singularity escapes its containment field, often referred to as a "singuloose," it will attract and then consume everything in its way.

In such circumstances, there is little to be done other than running in the opposite direction.
