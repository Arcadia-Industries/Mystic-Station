  ## Departmental Radio

  You are able to send messages over your departmental radio channels using [color=#a4885c]colon (:)[/color] followed by the
  department letter as long as you're wearing a headset with your department's encryption key.

  Examine your headset to see the department channels available to you.

  - t - [color=#8f4a4b]Syndicate[/color]

  - y - [color=#32cd32]CentCom[/color]

  default to the [color=#f37746]Engineering[/color] channel.
