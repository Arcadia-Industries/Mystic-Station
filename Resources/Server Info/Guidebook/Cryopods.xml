# Cryopods

Cryopods are a type of medical machinery used to place patients inside of for periods of time. The machine consists of a gas chamber with specific protections given to protect patients from being damaged by cold gases. It is also possible to injects solutions to patients through the cryopod. Cryopods require a properly built atmospheric setup to work, but power is only required to do automatic injection of chemicals.
