# Airloss (sometimes called oxyloss)
# Caused by asphyxiation or bloodloss.
# Note that most medicine and damaging effects should probably modify either asphyxiation or
# bloodloss, not this whole group, unless you have a wonder drug that affects both.

# As with airloss, most medicine and damage effects should probably modify either poison or radiation.
