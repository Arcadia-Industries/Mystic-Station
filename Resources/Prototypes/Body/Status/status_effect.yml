    Gravity has ceased affecting you, and you're floating around aimlessly. You'll need something large and heavy, like a
    wall or lattice, to push yourself off if you want to move. A jetpack would enable free range of motion. A pair of
    magboots would let you walk around normally on the floor. Barring those, you can throw things, use a fire extinguisher,
    or shoot a gun to move around via Newton's 3rd Law of Motion.
