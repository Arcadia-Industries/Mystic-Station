      I don't know if you're trained already, so I hope this'll help.
      AME controller needs LV power and an HV wire to output to. Check the area with a crowbar if you aren't sure.
      There should be an empty room next to where you found this, that room's wired for the AME.
      You can put an AME anywhere if you can get the wires to it, though.
      3x3 grid of AME parts, multitool them to unpack. Be careful not to 'trap' anything.
      AME controller adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) to any point.
      With only 1 core (what a 3x3 grid will get you), don't turn it up above 2.
      The golden rule is 2 injection for every 1 core. You can go lower to save fuel.
      Higher will burn the engine out and eventually make it explode. Don't.
      Don't forget to refuel it, it tends to stop at the worst possible time.

      DISCLAIMER: S.E.C codes are not to be treated as gospel, as they are a amalgamation of general suggestions of how to run a commericlal ship's security.
      However, violating them should be generally avoided, and abuse will be punished accordingly.
      
      PROPER ARRESTS:
      In most situations a non-lethal option is both more effective and humane. You may not harm crewmembers not causing direct harm to you.
      In order to detain a crewmember:
      1. Subdue the offender (via your stun baton or taser) and handcuff them.
      2. Bring them into the interregation room, you may stripsearch them for contraband there
      3. Prove the accused of a crime, via collecting evidence from reliable sources
      4. You may write a document, detailing the code of the crime, the criminal and the accusing party.
      5. Punish according to the code. Track the time on y
      
      Punishments are conducted by the warden. Any further matters must be resolved with higher authority.
      
      CRIMINAL CODES: 
      XX1: tresspass, petty theft and actively preventing security from making an arrest carry a 2 minute brig setnece
      XX2: posession of contraband, trespassing into high-security zones (such as armory or captain's office) or theft of sensitive items carry a 5 minute brig setence
      XX3: murder or grand sabotage with the intent of the former is a crime worthy of death penalty. 
      You can only carry it out with substantial proof and approval of a higher authroity, such as the captain.
      
      You may reduce the setnece in case of cooperation with security.
      Good luck, and remember to be civil in proseuction.
