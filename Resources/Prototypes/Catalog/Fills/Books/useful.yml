      To deal with bloodloss, we want two pills. One will stop bleeding, so we'll call it 'stopper.'
      The other will heal. This is Dexalin Plus.

      Solars are a safe and easy supplemental power source. Their uptime is hurt by the fact the station tend to block them from receiving sunlight,
      but they can keep power running long enough to get the more heavy duty generators running.

      Solars take orange HV cable. There's probably some near them. Ensure there is a continuous connection between all of the HV cable of the solars,
      including the actual panels in space, and the station's main HV loop that delivers power to the SMESes.
      Basically, connect all the orange wires in the area.

      Next, take a look at the computer. Make the angle match the sun's angle. Next, adjust how fast the solars rotate to try to
      keep up with it. This will be somewhere around 6 degrees. Check back occasionally to resync as they will inevitably drift.

      Robust harvest increases potency.
      All plants contain chemicals. A plant's potency increases how many chemicals it has.
      If you are growing a plant for its chemical effects, you want to use robust harvest to
      make the plant have more chemicals.

      Diethylamine increases growing speed. If you just want to grow a lot of a plant,
      but don't need to increase its chemicals, use diethylamine. You'll need to ask chemistry.
      Maybe trade with them for some of your potent medicinal plants.
