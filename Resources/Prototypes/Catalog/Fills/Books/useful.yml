      To deal with bloodloss, we want two pills. One will stop bleeding, so we'll call it 'stopper.'
      The other will heal. This is Dexalin Plus.

      'Stopper'
      100u beaker. Dispenser to 10u. Carbon, Oxygen, Glucose; Dispenser to 15u. Glucose, Sulfiric Acid. Transfer to chem master buffer.
      Repeat 3 times. Discard 30u leaving 150u. Add 350 units of iron. Make 10 pills.

      'Dexalin Plus'
      2 100u beakers. Grind 1 plasma into one. Fill the rest with oxygen. Put the dexalin in the chem master buffer. Set the plasma beaker aside.
      Take out 30u at a time. Put in dispenser. Dispenser to 30u. Iron, Carbon. Put Dexalin Plus back into buffer. Repeat until all Dexalin is Dexalin Plus.

      Solars are a safe and easy supplemental power source. Their uptime is hurt by the fact the station tend to block them from receiving sunlight,
      but they can keep power running long enough to get the more heavy duty generators running.

      Solars take orange HV cable. There's probably some near them. Ensure there is a continuous connection between all of the HV cable of the solars,
      including the actual panels in space, and the station's main HV loop that delivers power to the SMESes.
      Basically, connect all the orange wires in the area.

      Next, take a look at the computer. Make the angle match the sun's angle. Next, adjust how fast the solars rotate to try to
      keep up with it. This will be somewhere around 6 degrees. Check back occasionally to resync as they will inevitably drift.

      Robust harvest increases potency.
      All plants contain chemicals. A plant's potency increases how many chemicals it has.
      If you are growing a plant for its chemical effects, you want to use robust harvest to
      make the plant have more chemicals.

      Diethylamine increases growing speed. If you just want to grow a lot of a plant,
      but don't need to increase its chemicals, use diethylamine. You'll need to ask chemistry.
      Maybe trade with them for some of your potent medicinal plants.

      If you are reading this ahead of time, please ensure the disk is in a safe location and pinpointers have been
      distributed to other heads. Do not carry both a pinpointer and the disk. It will be of no use to you when dead.

      In the event the station is under attack by hostile military forces, normal operating procedures no longer apply.
      Immediately put security on high alert. Release any prisoners being held for minor infractions.

      Make an announcement over the communications console. Most crew who you would normally not trust with this sense of information have a shared interest in
      not dying and any bloodlust they have can be temporarily redirected. After this, relocate immediately as this telegraphs your location as being near a
      communications console.

      Try to link up with security or other heads you trust and decide how you are going to defend the disk. Keeping it on your person is
      highly discouraged. This allows enemy forces to pinpoint both the location of the disk and YOU. You, who are under every obligation to defend
      this ship with your life, musn't sacrifice the tactical advantage. Any defensive setup should be near the disk, but the disk should not be on anyone's person
      if they intend to fight. The CMO may be able to place it in an assistant's chest cavity.
