# Engineering Tech Tree
# anything not covered by other trees will come here - but this tree will primarily focus on power and utility
# (for example AppliedMusicology and Avionics would fall under here for now)
# things like robotics and computer tech will be here until separate branches are made
# power analysis unit (basically a power monitor that prints results after n minutes, bit boring but still a step up from points imo)
    #unlock the various better generators and such - really just how things are now but you have to build for the (not)points I guess
# robot analyser and robot fabricator (analyser to unlock latter, latter requires only basic materials to make robots)

# Security Tech tree <- low priority
# never allow sec tech to be directly printable via main lathe, always work with them
# impact analysis dummy (tracks damage, link to terminal for tech unlocks)
    #(unlock shields and vests for sec techfab (make them earn it))
# impact analysis vest (same as above but wearable... submit to scanner for unlocks?)
    #unlock armor forge which can make sec hardsuits, bombsuits, and riot armor
# impact analysis hardsuit (same as above...)
    #(unlock super sec hardsuit)

# Agricultural Tech Tree <- low priority - can be integrated in to basic tools research and engineering
# Produce analyser (similar to chem analyser -
#   perhaps add an auto grind tool for certain objects that treat the solid objects as pills going in to water)
# Seed Cloner (takes biomass, clones seeds)
# Seed Mutator (depends on progress towards plant mutations)

#Xenoarcheology
# basic analysis tools provided as non-mutually exclusive basic tech
# analysis device can be used on artefact based on trigger type
# hidden tech provided will be based on the artefact

#everything under here will be re-allocated in some wayS
