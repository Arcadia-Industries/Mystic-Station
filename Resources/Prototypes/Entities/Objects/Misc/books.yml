        When it comes to getting robusted, it's all about strategy. Do it right and you'll be the envy of the station. Do it wrong and the gods themselves may turn against you. Personally, I always aim for the former...

        First things first: let the insults fly! This is your chance to really let your opponent know what you think of their ridiculously large shoes and that annoying bike horn.

        No conflict is complete without a little bit of physicality. Give your opponent a good shove or two, and if you're lucky, they'll stumble and fall, providing even more opportunities for insults.

        But beware, because by now your opponent is probably trying to kill you. So, try to calm things down a bit. It'll make you look good during the inevitable homicide investigation.

        If deescalation doesn't work, it's time to grab a weapon. But be smart about it - choose something that looks like it couldn't possibly be deadly, like this book.

        And if you're both still standing, it's time to pull out the big guns. Find the sharpest thing you can and end things, because everyone's getting kind of tired of this by now.

        Now parade your vanquished opponent through the halls to the medbay so that everyone knows just how robust you really are.

        Remember, it's all about conserving energy. Let your opponent do some of the escalation for you - it's a win-win!

        Get it right and you'll have the whole station calling you shitsec. Get it wrong and you'll face harmbatoning from the gods. Personally, I always aim for the former...

        They say the pen is mightier than the sword, but you don't have a sword, you have a stun baton, and as soon as you start writing, any suspect is going to leave.

        So, try starting your confrontations with words. It probably won't get you called shitsec, but it's also not likely to be very effective against someone with lethal intent.

        Your next move should be to use non-lethal or less lethal devices, like stun batons, disablers, flashes, and flashbangs. Just make sure you get some training on these before trying to use them - offering them to a suspect in exchange for their cooperation is not an effective use of these tools.

        If you're lucky enough to run into a suspect who is a lethal threat, it's time to bust out all the goodies you've been hoarding from the armory.

        For an extra intimidation factor, take your robusted suspects to the medbay to be healed instead of the brig. That way, the whole crew can see just how robust you are.

        The distribution network, or "distro" for short, is the station's lifeline. It's responsible for transporting air from atmospherics throughout the station.

        Relevant pipes are often painted Popping Subdued Blue, but a surefire way to identify them is to use a tray scanner to trace which pipes are connected to active vents on the station.

        The standard gas mix of the distribution network is 20 degrees celsius, 78% nitrogen, 22% oxygen. You can check this by using a gas analyzer on a distro pipe or any vent connected to it. Special circumstances may call for special mixes.

        When it comes to deciding on a distro pressure, there are a few things to consider. Active vents will regulate the station's pressure, so as long as everything is functioning properly, there's no such thing as too high of a distro pressure.

        A higher distro pressure will allow the distro network to act as a buffer between the gas miners and vents, providing a significant amount of extra air that can be used to re-pressurize the station after a spacing.

        A lower distro pressure will reduce the amount of gas lost in the event that the distro is spaced, a quick way to deal with distro contamination. It can also help slow or prevent over-pressurization of the station in the event of vent issues.

        Common distro pressures are in the range of 300-375 kPa, but other pressures can be used with knowledge of the risks and benefits.

        The pressure of the network is determined by the last pump pumping into it. To prevent bottlenecks, all other pumps between the miners and the last pump should be set to their maximum rate, and any unnecessary devices should be removed.

        You can validate the distro pressure with a gas analyzer, but keep in mind that high demand due to things like spacings can cause the distro to be below the set target pressure for extended periods. So, if you see a dip in pressure, don't panic - it might be temporary.

        The waste network is the primary system responsible for keeping the air on the station free of contaminants.

        You can identify the relevant pipes by their Pleasing Dull Red color or by using a tray scanner to trace which pipes are connected to the scrubbers on the station.

        The waste network is used to transport waste gasses to either be filtered or spaced. It is ideal to keep the pressure at 0 kPa, but it may sometimes be at a low non-zero pressure while in use.

        Technicians have the option to filter or space the waste gasses. While spacing is faster, filtering allows for the gasses to be reused for recycling or selling.

        The waste network can also be used to diagnose atmospheric issues on the station. High levels of a waste gas may suggest a large leak, while the presence of non-waste gases may indicate a scrubber configuration or physical connection issue. If the gases are at a high temperature, it could indicate a fire.

        Air alarms are located throughout stations to allow management and monitoring of the local atmosphere.

        The air alarm interface provides technicians with a list of connected sensors, their readings, and the ability to adjust thresholds. These thresholds are used to determine the alarm condition of the air alarm. Technicians can also use the interface to set target pressures for vents and configure the operating speeds and targeted gases for scrubbers.

        While the interface allows for fine-tuning of the devices under the air alarm's control, there are also several modes available for rapid configuration of the alarm. These modes are automatically switched to when the alarm state changes:
        - Filtering: The default mode
        - Filtering (wide): A filtering mode that modifies the operation of scrubbers to scrub a wider area
        - Fill: Disables scrubbers and sets vents to their maximum pressure
        - Panic: Disables vents and sets scrubbers to siphon

        A multitool can be used to link devices to air alarms.

        Below is a quick reference guide to several atmospheric devices:

        Passive Vents:
        These vents don't require power, they allow gases to flow freely both into and out of the pipe network they are attached to.

        Active Vents:
        These are the most common vents on the station. They have an internal pump, and require power. By default, they will only pump gases out of pipes, and only up to 101 kpa. However, they can be reconfigured using an air alarm. They will also lock out if the room is under 1 kpa, to prevent pumping gasses into space.

        Air Scrubbers:
        These devices allow gases to be removed from the environment and put into the connected pipe network. They can be configured to select specific gases when connected to an air alarm.

        Air Injectors:
        Injectors are similar to active vents, but they have no internal pump and do not require power. They cannot be configured, but they can continue to pump gasses up to much higher pressures.

        All of the NT14 series of Nanotrasen space stations operate under space law. All crew, passengers and visitors aboard are expected to know and follow these laws.

        SECTION 1: CRIMES

        Crimes are divided into Low Crimes and High Crimes.
        Low crimes can be charged, investigated, and punished directly by security. 
        High Crimes should be heard and judged in a court of law.
        Security personell can be tried in a Court-Martial for committing any High Crime, with the maximum listed punishment being applicable by the court martial.
        Each crime has at least three sections: Minimum Punishment, Maximum Punishment, and Special Considerations
          Any punishments below the maximum punishment can be applied and the minimum punishment must at least be applied.
          If someone has committed a crime, use common sense when applying punishment.
          Stealing someone's hat is very different from stealing the Nuclear Authentication Disk.
          In the event of multiple crimes in the same vein, like an individual that has committed maiming and murder on the same victim, only the charge for the most severe crime should be applied.
          When applying charges extenuating circumstances can apply, lifting the punishment for the crime entirely or applying a reduced sentence. 
        In the situation where the commission of the crime is justified should be decided by the ranking memberof security or the Captain. This includes situations such as:
          Justifiable homicide,
          Emergency requiring tresspass,
          Self defence, etc. 

        SECTION 1.1: SENTENCING MODIFIERS

        Solicitation, Accessory, Attempts and Conspiracy are to be treated and charged as if the perpetrator committed the associated crime. For example: an individual who is an accessory to murder will be punished as if they are charged with murder.
          Solicitation: Encouraging, bribing, requesting, or instructing someone to commit a crime, with the intent that the person being solicited commits the crime.
          Accessory: Assissting in the commission of a crime, without participating in the crime itself. knowing that a crime will be, has been, or is being committed.
          Attempts: Attempting to commit a crime, with the intent to carry out that crime.
          Conspiracy: Plannning to commit a crime, with the intent to eventually carry out that crime.

        SECTION 1.2: PUNISHMENT

        Execution
        Termination of life. Anyone who has been given a sentence of death may choose how they wish to die. They should also be allowed to receive painkillers, anesthesia, and/or tranquilizers.

         Normal Punishments
         Extended Confinement: Confinement in the brig until the end of the shift. Commonly known as "perma", or "permabrigging".
         Demotion: The restriction of an individual's access to certain areas aboard a vessel or facility. Aboard the station, this often means that an individual who has been demoted only has access in:
           Public hallways
           The mess hall
           Arrivals
           Maintenance
           Dorms

        SECTION 2: TREATMENT OF PRISONERS

        Prisoners still have certain rights that must be upheld by law enforcement:
          Prisoners must be granted adequate medical care. They should also be provided psychiatric and spiritual counselling if requested.
          Prisoners must be allowed access to communications equipment (often headsets or handheld radios) so long as they are not abused.
          Prisoners must be granted clothing, food, water, shelter and safety. If the brig is no longer safe, confinement must be established in another location.
          Prisoners must be given access to legal counsel during an interrogation if requested and available.
          Prisoners must be granted freedom of movement, and should not be restrained with handcuffs or other devices after incarceration unless there is an undue risk to life and limb. Similarly, any prisoners held for extended or permanent confinement should be held in the communal brig, and should not be confined to a solitary cell unless they pose a risk to life and limb.

        SECTION 3.1: HIGH CRIMES

        All maximum punishments marked with an asterisk are special circumstance only punishments (such as a Syndicate agent who has murdered several people).

        Murder
        To kill a sapient being with malicious intent and premeditation.
        Minimum: Confinement for ten (10) minutes
        Maximum: Execution*
        Notes: Premeditated and malicious and the key words here.

        Manslaughter
        To kill a sapient being without intent, or in a manner less extreme than murder. Includes provoked manslaughter, manslaughter in self defense, negligent manslaughter, and impassioned killing.
        Minimum: Confinement for five (5) minutes
        Maximum: Extended confinement
        Notes: Different from murder by virtue of lack of intent. If the actions of the perpetrator clearly did not intend to result in death, manslaughter is the appropriate charge.

        Maiming
        To inflict physical injury with the intent to disfigure, degrade appearance, or impair function.
        Minimum: Confinement for seven minutes and thirty seconds (7:30)
        Maximum: Extended confinement
        Notes: This also includes mistreatment of bodies such as the taking of trophies, and security severely injuring prisoners to prevent escape.

        Destruction of a Vessel or Habitat
        To engage in maliciously destructive actions which threaten to destroy, or successfully destroy a vessel or habitat.
        Minimum: Confinement for ten (10) minutes
        Maximum: Execution*
        Notes: This includes arson, bombing, tampering with Power, intentional decompression, sabotaging atmospherics, or tampering with the self-destruct.

        Damage or Destruction of Property
        To maliciously damage or deface public or private property or equipment, including legal evidence or recorded information.
        Minimum: Demotion
        Maximum: Extended confinement
        Notes: This is a step down from destruction of a vessel or habitat, and a step up from vandalism. It applies more towards spacing a person’s PDA, maliciously breaking interior windows or furniture, or damaging machinery. Note that this requires malicious intent.

        Kidnapping/Hostage Taking/Illegal Confinement
        To unlawfully take away, transport, or confine a sapient being against that individual’s will.
        Minimum: Containment for seven minutes and thirty seconds (7:30)
        Maximum: Execution*
        Notes: More severe punishment is appropriate depending on the motivation of the kidnapper. If an individual is held for ransom, the crime is considered Hostage Taking, and at a minimum should be given extended confinement. Notably, this includes the illegal confinement of an individual by security forces.

        Sexual Assault/Harassment
        To harass someone or attempt to force them into sexual situations.
        Minimum: Extended confinement
        Maximum: Exeuction
        This law is mostly included to allow people to deal with it in the event it does occur. These people will often invoke the wrath of the Gods.

        Rioting
        To engage in a violent public disturbance which involves damage to people or property.
        Minimum: Demotion
        Maximum: Extended confinement
        Notes: Separated from hooliganism by causing damage in a riot.

        Espionage
        The gathering or communication of confidential or secret information of the state to a foreign or unauthorized domestic recipient, or to intentionally misrepresent oneself as being an official of Nanotrasen.
        Minimum: Demotion and fifteen (15) minutes of confinement
        Maximum: Execution*
        Notes: Note that execution only applies if they have committed other severe crimes such as multiple other high crimes.

        Resisting Arrest/Breach of Arrest/Escape
        To intentionally and violently resist Security Officers or other authorized personnel in the execution of an arrest; to violently flee arrest; to escape arrest, custody, or confinement.
        Minimum: Additional five (5) minutes in the brig, on top of pre extisting sentence
        Maximum: Extended confinement
        Notes: Notably this only includes violently resisting arrest. Just because an accused person does not run to security with open arms does not mean they are resisting. Pushing or disarming does count. Execution can be sentenced by a Field Court Martial only if Extended Confinement isn't an option.

        SECTION 3.2: LOW CRIMES

        Assault
        To threaten to use physical force against someone without the intent to kill or maim, while also having the capability and/or intent to carry out that threat.
        Minimum: Confinement for three (3) minutes
        Maximum: Demotion
        Notes: Note that this doesn’t include “Irma kill u” over common radio, it requires intent and ability to carry out the threat of violence, like waving a knife at someone.

        Battery
        To use physical force against a person, including any unlawful and or unwanted touching of the person by an aggressor or by a substance utilized by them, either directly or indirectly.
        Minimum: Confinement for five (5) minutes, up to seven minutes and thirty seconds (7:30) for any injury that results in a visit to Medical.
        Maximum: Extended confinement
        Notes: The degree of injury should come into play a lot here. If someone just punched someone else, things should probably be handled outside of the brig.

        Theft
        To take the property of another individual, organization, or common property, without consent, and with the intent to deprive the rightful owner.
        Minimum: Confinement for two (2) minutes to seven minutes and thirty seconds (7:30) depending on severity of stolen item(s), confiscation and return of stolen item(s)
        Maximum: Demotion
        Notes: Even if an individual had access to items, removing them for unlawful personal use   or hiding them so others can’t use them   is still theft.

        Endangerment
        To recklessly put yourself or others in danger, either through direct action, or failure to act.
        Minimum: Confinement for two (2) minutes
        Maximum: Demotion
        Notes: Covers industrial accidents, industrial negligence, or even medical malpractice. Punishment can vary widely based on severity. This also includes self experimentation with regards to the Science department.

        Vandalism
        To intentionally deface or superficially damage public or private property.
        Minimum: Confinemnt for two (2) minutes, *or* five (5) minutes of community service
        Maximum: Demotion

        Tresspassing
        To enter an area which an individual does not have access to, whether by simple action, force, or coercion.
        Minimum: Removal from area and ticketing
        Maximum: Demotion
        Once again comes down to severity; breaking into the vault and refusing to leave should be punished more severely than following an engineer into the engineering lobby. Remember to make sure a trespasser was not invited in.

        Animal Cruelty
        To inflict unnecessary suffering or harm on a non sapient being with malicious intent.
        Minimum: Confinement for five (5) minutes and psychiatric counseling
        Maximum: Demotion
        Notes: This doesn’t include legitimate and authorized experiments on monkeys, or killing chickens for meat; but stuffing a dog in disposals definitely counts. setting monkeys on fire for kicks is fine provided you are science. Unauthorized experiments on animals may also be included.

        Controlled Substances/Equipment
        To wrongfully use, possess, manufacture, or distribute any controlled substances or items.
        Minimum: Ticketing
        Maximum: Confiscation and interrogation
        Notes: Yet again comes down to severity; possession of a fully automatic weapon with lethal ammunition should be punished more severely than a single syringe of space drugs. How the person in question is using the item should also be taken into account, If a salvage is using an energy sword from a traitor they killed in order to kill carp on wrecks then it's fine realistically, if they are using it to kill the clown, then its an issue.

        Hooliganism
        To intentionally engage in disruptive behavior such as indecent exposure, belligerent drunkenness, disorderly shouting, or aggressive assembly.
        Minmum: Confinement until sobered up
        Maximum: Demotion
        Notes: This is kind of a catch all for malicious disruption. Note that only aggressive drunkenness counts, drowning your sorrows in the bar quietly is only punishable by your liver and your employer.

        Cruelty and Maltreatment
        To maltreat, be cruel to, or oppress an individual as that individual’s superior, or someone with authority over that individual.
        Minimum: Confinement for five (5) minutes.
        Maximum: Demotion
        Notes: This largely applies to security and their treatment of people, either by using excessive force in detainment, improper punishment, or mistreating prisoners, but also applies to Officers using their position abusively, like demanding favors in exchange for promotion, or intimidating others to avoid punishment.

        Evasion of Arrest/Failure to comply with a warrant
        To non-violently resist, escape, or avoid arrest or the execution of a search warrant by a Security officer or otherwise authorized member of the Security team.
        Minimum: Confinement for two (2) minutes, education of Standard Operating Procedures and Space Law
        Maximum: Demotion
        Notes: This includes hiding from security, refusing to report to the brig if properly presented with charges, or locking oneself in a workplace.
