# There is a newer, better version of the donutbox from tgstation included in the
# donut.rsi. The reason it isn't implemented is it requires a StackVisualizer offsetting
# the layer sprite by a couple pixels everytime a new donut is added. It also requires
# an alpha color which -Y- said he would implement.
