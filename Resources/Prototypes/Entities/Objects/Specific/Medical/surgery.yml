# NOTE: Laser Scapel and the Plasma Saw are intended to be research items, and should be used as such when surgery exists later.
# The other research equivilents to the surgery items haven't been added yet because I'm writing this while replacing the CEV-Eris surgery tools. Nothing "new" has been added other than the plasma saw (which in of itself can be seen as a replacement to the advanced circular saw.)
