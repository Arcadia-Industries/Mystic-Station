  # Criminal Records
  Criminal records are a console accessible in every station's security department, it serves the purpose of tracking and managing every crime anybody in the crew manifest has ever committed.

  Anyone can open the console's UI, but only those with Security access can modify anything.

  The UI is composed by the following elements:
  - A search bar that has a filter next to it that lets you filter the crewmembers by their names, fingerprints or DNA.

  - A list of all the crewmembers in the manifest, selecting one of the entries will make the criminal records of a crewmember appear.

  - The criminal records themselves, where you can:
    - See general information about a crewmember, like their name, fingerprints, DNA, etc.

    - Change the security status between None, Wanted and Detained. When setting it to Wanted you will be asked to write a reason.

    - Once someone has been arrested, remember to update their status on the console so everyone knows they no longer need to be captured.

    - After they've done their time, release them and update their status to None so nobody thinks they are an escaped convict.

    - Open the Crime History window to check or modify it.

  - The Crime History window lists someone's crimes and can be modified in multiple ways:
    - Automatically, just by setting someone's status to arrested. The reason will be added to "ARRESTED:" so it's easy to see the automated entries.

    - Adding a new line by clicking "Add" and writing something in the input box. When adding a record, remember to mention their crime and sentence, the console will automatically insert the shift's time so you don't need to!

    - Select a line of history the clown added and clicking "Delete" to keep records clean.

  Now you can be the desk jockey you've always wanted to be.
