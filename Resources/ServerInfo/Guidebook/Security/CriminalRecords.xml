# Criminal Records
How do you keep track of all the syndies and selfantags turning the station to shit? Criminal records!

Criminal records are accessible in a console in every station's security department.

Select a crewmember's record on the left then you can get to business, if you have security access of course.

There are many things you can do:

- Add a warrant for someone's arrest. Give a reason for all officers on the radio to hear, then selected wanted.
   They will get set to wanted status which will show up on sechuds. (not currently implemented)

- Once someone has been arrested, click arrest so everyone knows they no longer need to be captured.

- After they've done their time, release them so nobody thinks they are an escaped convict.

- Add their crime and sentence to their history tab.
   It will automatically insert the shift's time so you don't need to!

Now you can be the desk jockey you've always wanted to be.
