  # Criminal Records
  Criminal records are a console accessible in every station's security department, it serves the purpose of tracking and managing every crime anybody in the crew manifest has ever committed.

  If you have security access, you can open the console's UI, which is composed by the following elements:
  - A search bar that has a filter next to it that lets you filter the crewmembers by their names, fingerprints or DNA.

  - A list of all the crewmembers in the manifest, selecting one of the entries will make the criminal records of a crewmember appear.

  - The criminal records themselves, where you can:
    - See general information about a crewmember, like their name, fingerprints, DNA, etc.

    - Check and modify their criminal history, by adding or removing criminal records. When adding a record, remember to mention their crime and sentence, the console will automatically insert the shift's time so you don't need to!

    - Add a warrant for someone's arrest, they will get set to wanted status. Remember to give a reason for all officers on the radio to hear.

    - Once someone has been arrested, remember to update their status on the console so everyone knows they no longer need to be captured.

    - After they've done their time, release them and update their status so nobody thinks they are an escaped convict.

  Now you can be the desk jockey you've always wanted to be.
