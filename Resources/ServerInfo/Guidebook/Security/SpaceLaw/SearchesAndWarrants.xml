  A personnel search is a seizure of the objects in a person's backpack, hands, coat, belt and pockets.

  If any contraband is found during a search the officer may choose to further the search into a detainment or simply confiscate the restricted items. After the search is conducted all legal items are to be returned to the person.

  A crewmate may legally decline any search conducted without a warrant while the alert level is green. Should be noted that if the alert level is blue or above all personnel searches are legal and no longer require a warrant.

  A departmental search is the sweep of an entire area/department for contraband. It is recommended the officers are extremely thorough, checking all lockers, crates and doors. These can only be done with a warrant signed by the according department head or highest standing command staff (the captain in most cases).

  A warrant is a signed document stating security may search a specific person or place.

  A warrant regarding a personnel requested by a normal officer may be approved by the captain, HoS or the department head of the person being search, however a warrant requested by the HoS can not be approved by themselves.

  Warrants for department sweeps may be signed off by the department's head or the highest ranking command staff. The process of writing a document may be disregarded IF the appropriate command member accompanies the officers throughout their search.
