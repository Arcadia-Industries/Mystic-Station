  Any prisoner in custody can be subjected to implantation or implant removal procedures, so long as it's within reason.

  The process of adding an implant should not prolong the detainees sentence, meaning you can not hold them longer to administer the implant, unless stated otherwise. A former inmate can be requested to undergo implantation at a later point in time if they fit the circumstances during their confinement, they must comply.

  The following have been listed out with special circumstances, anything not in this list can still be applied, given proper legal context. A prisoner can still receive implantation procedures without meeting the circumstances if they give their clear permission.

  - Tracking Implants: Trackers can be applied to any suspect that has been convicted of a violent crime (the red linked crimes).

  - Mind Shields: Shields can be administered to any inmate who has been clearly mind controlled, lost control of themselves, or a suspect charged with unlawful control. Unlike standard implantation you may hold a prisoner until you finish issuing Mind Shields, so long as it's done in a timely fashion. If a suspect refuses cooperate or the implant fails to function they can be charged with Refusal of Mental Shielding.

  ## Removal

  A suspect can be forced to receive implant removal if there is strong reasonable proof that they have been implanted, such as an officer seeing them use one or their prints being on a discarded injector.

  Unlike implantation procedure a prisoner can have their sentence entirely delayed or extended until they comply with the procedure, as long as security are actively making attempts to preform it. Akin to implanting, if an inmate gives their clear permission, implant removal can proceed without proof.
