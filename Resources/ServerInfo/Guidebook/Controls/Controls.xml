<Box Orientation="Vertical">You can change the keybinds at any time here:</Box>
<Box Orientation="Vertical"><CommandButton Text="ui-options-tab-controls" Command="options 1"/></Box>

## Basic controls
We shall politely assume that you already know how to use [keybind="MoveUp"/].[keybind="MoveLeft"/].[keybind="MoveDown"/].[keybind="MoveDown"/] to walk.
Beyond that, there's a handful primary interactions in SS14, ordered by importance:

- Use [color=#a4885c][keybind="Use"/][/color] to pick up items and activate objects like buttons or computers, and [color=#a4885c][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"/][/color] to activate items. You can also press [color=#a4885c]alt[/color] while doing this to trigger alternate interactions for some objects.
- You can also quickly activate and alt-interact with items you're holding by pressing [color=#a4885c][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"/][/color] and [color=#a4885c][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"/][/color] respectively.
- Use [color=#a4885c][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/color] to open the context menu. You can then either use [color=#a4885c][keybind="UILeftClick"/][/color] on an entry just like you would in the world, or use [color=#a4885c][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/color] on it again to open the verb menu, which gives you more complex ways to interact with an object.
- You can use [color=#a4885c][keybind="ExamineEntity"/][/color] on objects to examine them, and get their name and a detailed (though often humorous) description.

You can quickly try out these controls with the monkey below (note: clicking it only works in-game and not in the lobby), and at any point in this guidebook if you're shown an entity, using [color=#a4885c][keybind="ExamineEntity"/] to examine will always work[/color]:

## Inventory
In order to move items around in your inventory and between containers, you can click the item (or item name) to move it to your active hand, and then click the spot you want it to go (either a slot in your HUD, or the container).

You can only use the item currently in your active hand (highlighted with a border); in order to swap between which hand you're currently using, you can press [color=#a4885c][keybind="SwapHands"/][/color] on your input device (usually your keyboard) to change active hands.

Opening containers in your inventory is easy as well, either hover over the item and activate it with [color=#a4885c][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"/][/color] or click on the bag icon in the bottom right corner of the slot it is in.
Alternatively, you can use the [color=#a4885c][keybind="OpenBackpack"/][/color] and [color=#a4885c][keybind="OpenBelt"/][/color] keybinds to quickly open your bag and your belt, respectively.

When you open a container a window will pop up showing the contents of the container and how much space it has available to hold things.
All items have an assigned size, some too large to fit into most or all containers.

To drop items, you can press [color=#a4885c][keybind="Drop"/][/color], and to drop them more violently (also known as throwing), you can press [color=#a4885c][keybind="ThrowItemInHand"/][/color].

A slightly advanced way to manage your inventory is to use [color=#a4885c][keybind="SmartEquipBackpack"/][/color]. If your active hand is currently empty, this hotkey will pull out the latest item that was put in your bag. If you have an item in your hand, the same hotkey will put said item into your bag.
[color=#a4885c][keybind="SmartEquipBelt"/][/color] works exactly the same, but uses your belt as storage.
## Actions
On the left side of your HUD, there's a bar showing various actions you can take.
You can hover over each one to see a name and description of the action, this will usually tell you what action it is and what it does.
You can click on an action to invoke it, or press the assigned number key to invoke the action without clicking on it.

In order to rearrange your actions, open the actions menu using [keybind="OpenAbilitiesMenu"/] and you can simply drag and drop them to other slots, right click to remove them, or use the actions menu to (re)add them.

## Movement
There's a good few things that can modify your movement; most notably, slipping (which requires you to walk with [color=#a4885c]shift[/color] to avoid, usually.) and a lack of gravity.
Slipping simply stuns you for a bit, but no gravity can be deadly if you're off station and wander more than about 1.5m away from the nearest wall or solid structure, as you'll lose your grip and no longer be able to move without throwing something.
