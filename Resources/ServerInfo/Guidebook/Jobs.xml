  # Jobs

  SS14 has a large number of jobs, divided into seven major departments:

  ## Service
  This department includes many miscellaneous jobs, such as the Janitor, Clown, Mime, Musician, Chef, Bartender, Detective, the Head of Personnel, and other jobs who exist to serve the station.

  It primarily functions as folks who entertain, clean, and serve the rest of the crew, with the exception of passengers, who have no particular job beyond getting lost in maintenance.

  ## Cargo
  Cargo consists of the Cargo technicians, Salvage specialists, and the Quartermaster. As a department, it is responsible for resource distribution and trade, capable of buying and selling things on the galactic market.

  For the most part, this means they scrounge around the station and assorted wrecks to find materials to sell and redistribute, and purchase materials that other departments (*cough cough* [bold][italics]Science[/italics][/bold] *cough*) request.

  ## Security
  Security consists of the Security cadets, Lawyers, Security officers, Warden and the Head of Security. As a department, it is responsible for dealing with troublemakers and non-humanoid threats like giant rats and space carp.

  As a result of this, and the need to walk a fine line, security sometimes is overwhelmed by angry crew (don't kill the clown), and it is important for it's members to try and stay on their best behavior.

  ## Medical
  Medical consists of the Medical interns, Chemists, Medical doctors, Psychologists and the Chief Medical Officer. As a department, it is responsible for taking care of the crew, treating and/or cloning the wounded and dead and preventing everyone from dying a horrible, bloody death in a closet somewhere.

  Medical is one of the more well-equipped departments, with the ability to locate injured crew using the crew monitor, a nigh infinite supply of chems (should chemistry be on-par), and the ability to rapidly diagnose and vaccinate contagious diseases (when diseases are re-implemented).

  ## Science
  Science consists of Research assistants, Scientists and the Research director. As a department, it is responsible for researching technologies, anomalies and artifacts, upgrading machines, and printing new and useful devices.

  Scientists should seek out new artifacts and anomalies to study, as well as solicit departments to help upgrade their machines and tools of the trade.

  ## Engineering
  Engineering consists of Technical assistants, Station engineers, Atmospheric technicians, and the Chief Engineer. As a department, it is responsible for keeping the station powered, its structure intact and its air supply working.

  Engineering is readily equipped to safely go into space or spaced areas, and as such they should always attempt to repair uninhabitable parts of the station.

  ## Command
  Command consists of the Captain, the Head of Personnel, the Head of Security, the Chief Engineer, the Chief Medical Officer, the Research Director, and the Quartermaster. As a department, it is responsible for keeping the station and its departments running efficiently.

  Command members should always be relatively competent in their respective departments and attempt to delegate responsibility and direct work.
