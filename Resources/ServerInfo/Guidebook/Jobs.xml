  # Jobs

  SS14 has a large number of jobs, divided into seven major departments:

  ## Donk Company
  This corporation hires positions such as janitor, passengers, clown, mime, musician, chef, bartender, the head of personnel, and other jobs who exist to serve the station.

  It primarily functions as folks who entertain, clean, and serve the rest of the crew, with the exception of passengers who have no particular job beyond getting lost in maintenance.

  ## Cybersun Industries
  Cybersun Industries hires the cargo technicians, operators, and the Cybersun manager. As a corporation, it responsible resource distribution and trade, capable of buying and selling things on the galactic market.

  For the most part, this means they scrounge around the station and assorted wrecks to find materials to sell and redistribute, and purchase materials other departments request.

  ## Gorlex Marauders
  Gorlex Marauders employ the Gorlex privates, lawyers, detectives, Gorlex troopers, Interrogators, and the Gorlex Commander. As a company it is responsible for dealing with troublemakers and non-humanoid threats like giant rats and carp.

  As a result of this, and the need to walk a fine line, security sometimes is overwhelmed by angry crew (don't kill the clown), and it is important for its members to try and stay on their best behavior.

  ## Interdyne Pharmaceutics
  Interdyne Pharmaceutics consists of the medical interns, chemists, medical doctors, and the chief medical officer. As a department it is responsible for taking care of the crew, treat and/or clone the wounded and dead, treat disease, and prevent everyone from dying a horrible, bloody death in a closet somewhere.

  Interdyne Pharmaceutics is one of the more well-equipped companies, with the ability to locate injured crew using the crew monitor, a nigh infinite supply of chems should chemistry be on-par, and the ability to rapidly diagnose and vaccinate contagious diseases.

  ## Waffle Corporation
  Waffle Corporation consists of research assistants, scientists, and the research director. As a company it is responsible for researching technologies and artifacts, upgrading machines, and printing new and useful devices.

  Scientists should seek out new artifacts to study, as well as solicit departments to help upgrade their machines.

  ## Weathermaker Inc.
  Weathermaker Inc. consists of technical assistants, station engineers, atmospheric technicians, and the chief engineer. As a company it is responsible for keeping the station powered, its structure intact and its air supply working.

  Weathermaker is readily equipped to go safely into space, and as such they should always attempt to repair uninhabitable parts of the station.

  ## Syndicate Command
  Syndicate Command consists of the Station Commander, the head of personnel, the Gorlex commander, the chief engineer, the chief medical officer, the research director, and the Cybersun manager. As an entity it is responsible for keeping the station and its companies running efficiently.

  Syndicate Command members should always be relatively competent in their respective departments and attempt to delegate responsibility and direct work.
