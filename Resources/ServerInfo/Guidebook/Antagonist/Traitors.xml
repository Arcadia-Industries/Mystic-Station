  # Traitors

  <Box>
    Your PDA beeps to life, and begins playing a message:
  </Box>
  <Box>
    [color=#ff0000]Whiskey, Echo, Whiskey... Lima, Alpha, Delta...[/color]
  </Box>
  <Box>
    As your PDA returns to silence, you feel determined.

  - A Traitor is an antagonist employed by the Syndicate. They have access to various Syndicate tools and weapons through their [color=#a4885c]Uplink[/color].
  - Traitors can use codewords to identify themselves to one another in order to cooperate. These are present in your character menu, which can be opened by pressing [color=#a4885c][keybind="OpenCharacterMenu"/][/color].
  - In a Traitor round, any player can be a Traitor aside from department heads, the captain, or any security officers. Do note, however; you can still be promoted to these positions after the round begins.
  - Traitors should focus primarily on completing their objectives successfully by the end of the round, and they should try not to help the station if they can do so without being revealed.

  ## The Uplink
  <Box>

  </Box>
  - The [color=#a4885c]Uplink[/color] is one of the most important tools of Traitor, as it can purchase more tools and weapons with [color=#a4885c]telecrystals[/color](TC).

  </Box>
  - 20 [color=#a4885c]Telecrystals[/color] are given at roundstart to give traitors an edge on the station. Other traitors can trade their [color=#a4885c]telecrystals[/color] with (or steal them from) yourself, and vice versa, which can exceed the normal given amount.
  - You can also obtain 5 extra telecrystals by [color=#ff0000]butchering[/color] (not gibbing!) the captain's pet fox, [color=orange]Renault[/color].
  - To open your uplink, check your [color=#a4885c]PDA[/color] and set the ringtone as your uplink code.
