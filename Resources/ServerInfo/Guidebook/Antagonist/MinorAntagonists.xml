  # Minor Antagonists

  Most, if not all Minor Antagonists are ghost-controlled roles that give dead people new ways to cause chaos around the station. They are spawned through random events.

  # Revenant

  </Box>

  A Revenant is given powers to haunt the crew and steal life essence from them.

  ## Essence

  - Your [color=#a4885c]essence[/color] is your very own life force, and a way to use abilities for a cost; don't let it drop to zero.
  - To gain [color=#a4885c]essence[/color], you first inspect various souls for their worth. More worthy souls grant more essence.
  - However, merely checking their worth isn't enough to collect [color=#a4885c]essence[/color]. You must siphon it either when the victim is critical, dead, or sleeping.
  - A good start is to go to Medical or Dorms; but be weary, you are vulnerable to attacks when you siphon a soul. Taking damage reduces your [color=#a4885c]essence[/color]! So plan your attacks wisely.

  ## Shop And Powers

  - Using [color=#a4885c]stolen essence[/color] gotten from siphoning souls, you can gain skills for mischief, such as environmental destruction, power grid disruption and electrocution through the shop.
  - Using powers leave you vulnerable to attacks for some time, so plan ahead and prepare before attacking.

  # Rat King

  A Rat King is a giant rat capable of setting up a nest and creating rat servants to do their bidding (usually to get food).
  While rat kings are catagorized as a minor antagonist role, they have no objectives stating they must harm the crew.
  In reality, one could setup a peaceful coalition between the heads of the station and the Rat King.
  Do be warned though; as you are not crew, security [italics]absolutely[/italics] has the right to shoot you on sight.

  ## Abilities

  Abilities come at a cost to the Rat King's hunger. Simply eating replenishes it.
  The three most important of your abilities include:

  </Box>
  - Raise an Army of [color=#a4885c]Rat Servants[/color].
  - Command your servants to your will; you can make them follow you, attack others, or just roam freely.
  - Conjure a cloud of miasma, which heals you and your servants.

  # Space Dragon

  A Space Dragon is a giant dragon that creates space carp rifts and eats the crew.
  They can either be generated through a random event, brought onto the station from an expedition or a salvage wreck, or can be called in by a [color=#a4885c]Space Ninja[/color].

  ## Abilities

  - Devour critical or dead victims.
