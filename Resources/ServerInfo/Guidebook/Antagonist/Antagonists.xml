# Antagonists

Antagonists are the driving force of every shift, usually creating conflict and defying the crew. Their goals can vary a lot, but they usually require some thievery, sabotage, or murder.

## Various Antagonists

Antagonists can take many forms, like:
- Nuclear operatives, with the goal of infiltrating and destroying the station.
- Traitors infiltrating the crew who can assassinate targets and steal high value items.
- Several non-humanoid creatures, who usually just try to bring down as many crewmembers as they can. 

## How to deal with them
Unless you are security or command, you do not have much responsibility to deal with antagonists other than calling security.

 Fighting monsters and nuclear operatives are alright because they are a direct threat to your safety, but you should not abandon your job looking for a traitor to fight.
