# Space Ninja

The Space Ninja is a ghost role randomly available mid-late game. If you pick it you will be given your gear, your objectives and the greeting.

As a ninja you are employed by the spider clan to sabotage the station. You fight with a ninja's honor so that means no guns, those are for cowards.

## Gear

<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingHandsGlovesSpaceNinja" Caption="ninja gloves"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingOuterSuitSpaceNinja" Captain="ninja suit"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SpiderCharge" Caption="spider clan charge"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="EnergyKatana" Captain="energy katana"/>
</Box>

Your single most important item is your suit, without it none of your abilities would work.
Your suit requires power to function, its internal battery can be replaced by clicking on it **with a better one**.

Next in line is the gloves which, once turned on with the action, can do various cool things:
- emagging doors
- draining power from apcs, substations, smeses
- shocking people chasing you
- completing some objectives like calling in a threat or stealing research data.

Your spider clan charge in your pocket can be used only in its designated area. Arm it by planting on a wall or something then get out.

Your energy katana lets you teleport to anywhere you can see, can be teleported into your hand and is about as dangerous as an energy sword and a katana combined.

You also start with a microbomb implant so if you still fail miserably, you won't have tiders looting your sweet noslips.
