  # A.P.E.

  The Anomalous Particle Emitter is a machine used to interface with anomalies. It is the primary way of manipulating the stats of an anomaly.
  It can either be controlled by hand, or it can be hooked up with a [color=#a4885c]Network Configurator[/color] to a signal source, like a [color=#a4885c]Remote Signaling Device[/color] or an [color=#d381c9]Anomaly Synchronizer[/color].

  The C.H.I.M.P is basically just an A.P.E condensed into a handgun. It can be researched through the [color#d381c9]Advanced Anomaly Research[/color] technology.
  You can switch particles by using [color=#a4885c][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"/][/color], and you can use an energy gun recharger to recharge it.

  A.P.E.s and C.H.I.M.P.s can shoot three different kinds of anomalous particles: Delta, Epsilon, and Zeta. Each particle types has certain effects:

  - [color=#a4885c]Danger:[/color] Increases the severity of an anomaly.
  - [color=#a4885c]Unstable:[/color] Increases the instability of an anomaly.
  - [color=#a4885c]Containment:[/color] Increases the stability of an anomaly, at the cost of health.

  Which particle type corresponds to each effect is unique to each anomaly, and can be learned by scanning the anomaly.

  The A.P.E. can also be locked by anyone with [color=#d381c9]Science[/color] access, which prevents it from being deconstructed, turned on or off, or having the particle type switched.
