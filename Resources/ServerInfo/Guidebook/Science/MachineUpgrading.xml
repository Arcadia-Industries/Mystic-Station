  # Machine Upgrading

  NOTICE: Machine Upgrades are currently being discussed to be removed, so take this guide with a grain of salt!

  Machines help the station run smoothly, and as a scientist, you can help them run even better!

  You can examine each machine part to see both the type and the rating, which range from 1 (Stock Parts) to 4 (Bluespace Parts, cannot be unlocked through technologies!).

  Parts of higher levels can be researched (excluding Bluespace Parts), or they can be found through artifacts or Salvage.

  ## Upgrading
  To know if a machine can be upgraded, you can examine it and check for the [color=#a4885c]lightning bolt[/color] icon in the lower right corner. Clicking on it will allow you to see what kinds of upgrades the machine has.

  To check what parts a machine needs, you can examine its board. Try it here:
  <Box Orientation="Vertical">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ProtolatheMachineCircuitboard"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CloningPodMachineCircuitboard"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="TraversalDistorterMachineCircuitboard"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ThermomachineFreezerMachineCircuitBoard"/>
  </Box>
  You can use any rating part for any part requirement. Using higher rated parts will increase how effective the machine is.

  If you want to upgrade an existing machine, simply deconstruct it with a screwdriver and crowbar, and replace the existing parts with parts of a higher level.

  You can also quickly upgrade machines by using an RPED, loading it with machine parts, and then clicking on a machine (after removing its maintenance panel, should it have one). It will quickly be upgraded with the best parts inserted.
