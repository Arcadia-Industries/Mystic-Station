  After death, a Diona can voluntarily destroy their body, releasing their "internal organs" as three Nymphs, with the player taking control of the Brain Nymph.
  It can talk but has no hands or inventory, and can't do much.

After 10 minutes a Nymph can reform into a full Diona. This will be a new randomised body with a new name, and there will be no evidence beyond their word that they are the same Diona.
