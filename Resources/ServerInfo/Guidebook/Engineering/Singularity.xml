  # Gravitational Singularity Engine

  The Gravitational Singularity Engine can yield infinite power, with no fueling required. It can also destroy the whole station with equal ease. It uses a Particle Accelerator to fire high energy particles at a Singularity Generator to form a singularity. The singularity then pulses radiation which is absorbed by Radiation Collectors.

  # Setting it up

  The Gravitational Singularity Engine requires 4 subsystems to work properly:

  ## Gravitational singularity generator
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SingularityGenerator"/>
  </Box>
  The generator should be anchored at the center of the containment area, since this is where the singularity should appear at.

  ## Containment field generators and Emitters
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Emitter"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ContainmentFieldGenerator"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ContainmentField"/>
  </Box>
  The emitters connect to MV cables and fire lasers as long as they have power and are turned on.
  Fire the emitters at enabled containment field generators to activate them.
  If two containment field generators are active, in range and are in the same cardinal axis, a containment field will appear.
  The containment field will repel the singularity, keeping it from escaping, and yield a little bit of power every time anything bounces off of them.
  The emitter lasers and the containment fields can also cause damage and/or cause you to be sent flying into deep space; avoid touching them when active.
  It is recommended to lock the emitters and containment field generators with [keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"/], to prevent any break-in no-gooders from loosing the singularity by simply switching off the field.

  ## Radition collectors
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RadiationCollector"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PlasmaTank"/>
  </Box>
  The radition collectors connect to HV cables and generate power from nearby radiation sources when turned on.
  Radiation collectors require a tank full of gaseous plasma in order to operate.
  Continous radiation exposure will gradually convert the stored plasma into tritium, so replace depleted plasma tanks with fresh ones regularly to maintain a high power output.

  ## Particle accelerator

  The Particle Accelerator (PA) is a multi-tile structure that launches accelerated particles from its emitters. Its emitters should always face the gravitational singularity generator.
  Some stations already have an unfinished PA. To complete it, first ensure there is a MV cable beneath the PA power box, anchor all the parts, and then add an LV cable to each part.
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CableApcStack"/>
  </Box>
  Then use a screwdriver to screw back the panels.
  [color=#a4885c]Scan parts[/color] using the PA control computer to check if it's operational (the PA will not function if you do not scan it!). If it shows up as incomplete, examine what's missing.
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ParticleAcceleratorControlBox"/>
  </Box>

  ## Turing on the Gravitational Singularity Engine

  [color=#a4885c]Do not[/color] turn the PA on unless all the other subsystems are working properly and there is enough power to start the engine.

  Turn power on using the PA control computer. Set the strength to an appropiate level. Currently the only appropriate level is [color=#f0684d]1[/color]; anything above that will ensure that singularity grows too strong to handle.
  The higher the output stength is set on PA control computer, the bigger the singularity will be.

  The PA will now draw power from the power net and start firing particles at the Gravitational singularity generator.

  A singularity will soon appear at the position of the Gravitational singularity generator.

  If no particles are hitting the singularity, the singularity will start to slowly decay until it disappears.

  ## Safety
  The singularity emits a large amount of radiation around it, so always keep a distance from it. Consider getting radiation shielding gear beforehand. Seek medical attention if you are experiencing health issues.

  </Box>

  The singularity might move around, but the containment field will repel it.
  If a singularity escapes its containment field, often referred to as a "singuloose," it will attract and then consume everything in its way, growing larger as it does so.

  In such circumstances, there is little to be done other than running in the opposite direction.
