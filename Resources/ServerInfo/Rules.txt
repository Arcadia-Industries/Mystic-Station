[color=#ff0000]YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 16 YEARS OF AGE TO PLAY ON WIZARD'S DEN SERVERS. ANY USER SUSPECTED OF BEING UNDER 16 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE BANNED UNTIL THEY ARE OF AGE.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]DISCONNECTING FROM OR IGNORING/EVADING ADMIN-HELPS WILL RESULT IN AN APPEAL ONLY BAN.[/color]

This is the "short" form of the rules, which has all the information any regular player should need. You can find the "long" form of the rules with more examples & clarifications of any ambiguity on our wiki at [color=#a4885c]wiki.spacestation14.io[/color], should you need it.

[color=#ff0000]Recent Changes[/color]
    - Revolutionary rules have been added (#12, #15)
    - Silicon rules have been added (#22)
    - Security/command rules have been updated to address forced borging (#21)

[color=#a4885c]01.[/color] [color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins may excercise discretion with rules as they see fit. If you rule lawyer or line skirt, you will get removed. Admins will answer for use of this privilege.

[color=#ff0000]ZERO TOLERANCE RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Absolutely no hate speech, slurs, bigotry, IC specism (demeaning other characters in-game due to their in-game race), or anything even remotely similar. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED)

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Absolutely no Erotic Roleplay (ERP) or sexual content, including direct or indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED) (Leeway is given to insults, ex: 'You are a dickhead', do not push it)

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Don't communicate in-game/in-character information through methods outside of the game (such as talking in Discord with other users actively playing or by talking to your sibling across the room while you are both playing). This is referred to as "Metacomming" and we are not able to police it, therefore it is strictly forbidden. (BOTH OR ALL OF YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED)

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Attempting to evade game bans will result in an automatic appeal-only permanent ban that is only appealable after six months. Attempting to evade job bans will result in an appeal-only permanent ban. (YOU WILL GET BANNED MUCH WORSE THAN YOU ALREADY WERE)

[color=#ff0000]GENERAL ETIQUETTE[/color]

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] These are English servers. Speak only English in IC and OOC.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs to play, gain an advantage, or disrupt the round/server. This includes autoclickers and auto-hotkey scripts.

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Don't "multi-key" (utilize multiple alt accounts). Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), or sending messages of no substance. All admin helps are sent to the SS14 Discord.

[color=#ff0000]IN GAME & ROLEPLAY RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Pick a realistic name that could appear on a birth certificate with at least a first and last name (leeway is given to this for Clowns, Mimes, and non-human races).
    - Names of notable famous or fictional persons or names that resemble/parody them are strictly forbidden. You are not clever if you slightly change a famous name around. Terrible names open you up to being politely reminded to change it, smited, or instantly banned, depending on severity.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Act like an actual human being on a space station in a low-roleplay (LRP) environment. Do not use text speak or emoticons IC, and do not refer to OOC things like admins in-game.

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] Don't be a dick. You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game.
    - Do not intentionally make other players' lives hell for your own amusement.
    - Antagonists have lots of leeway with this rule and may kill/sabotage as they see fit, but if it degrades the experience for majority of the rest of the server you will be told to stop.
    - [color=#ff0000]THE ROUND IS NOT OVER UNTIL THE END-ROUND SUMMARY APPEARS. KILLING SOMEONE FOR NO REASON BEFORE THIS WILL BE HANDLED ACCORDINGLY.[/color]
    - Antagonists have a lot of leeway with this rule and may kill/sabotage as they see fit, however if your behavior degrades the experience for the majority of the server you will be told to stop. Antagonists are still generally forbidden from causing massive station damage early into the round (less than 30 minutes) and are forbidden from needlessly prolonging rounds. For antagonist specific rules, see the "long" form of the rules at [color=#a4885c]wiki.spacestation14.io[/color].

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds or for actions outside of the game (this is referred to as "Metagrudging".)
    - Annoying players for IC reasons in the current round is fine; doing it across rounds or as a ghost role after they kill you is not.

[color=#a4885c]13.[/color] Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage (this is referred to as "Metagaming").
    - Using information you gain from outside your own character (such as spectating while a ghost, through screenshots or metacomms, or other means) to your advantage is strictly forbidden. You remember all events up until you fall unconscious, even after cloning. If you take a ghost role, unless otherwise stated, you DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING from your past life.

[color=#a4885c]14.[/color] Follow escalation rules and don't murder someone for slipping you, use common sense.
    - You can defend yourself to the extent of protecting your own life.
    - Security is unique in escalation and can escalate to less lethal to arrest criminals as needed.
    - Don't outright leave people to die if you get in a fight, make an effort to heal them or bring them to Medbay.
    - Adminhelp the situation if you think someone is over-escalating.
    - Department strikes, revolutions (ex: cargonia and any variation thereof), riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden. Other than for revolutionary antagonists, these activities are strictly forbidden. All players, including antagonists other than revolutionaries, must obtain admin permission before engaging in this behavior (forewarning: you are unlikely to get permission).

[color=#a4885c]15.[/color] Don't immediately ghost or suicide from your role if you do not get antagonist (referred to as "Antag-rolling").
    - This is not fair to other players actually waiting patiently for an antagonist round. Alternatively, if you do not want to play an antagonist or do not want to cause conflict, do not opt-in for antagonist roles.

[color=#a4885c]16.[/color] Don't rush for or prepare equipment unrelated to your job for no purpose other then to have it "just in case" (referred to as "Powergaming").
    - A medical doctor does not need insulated gloves, and the Head of Personnel does not need to give themselves armory access so they can go grab a gun.
    - Don't manufacture weapons, bombs, or death poisons before you know of any reason you would need them.

[color=#a4885c]17.[/color] Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew or other players at large while not an antagonist is forbidden (referred to as "self-antagging").

[color=#ff0000]SECURITY & COMMAND RULES[/color]
If you regularly play Security or Command roles and got this far, I applaud you for reading.

[color=#a4885c]18.[/color] If you sign up for a Command or Security role, you are expected to know the basics of the game, your job, and the job(s) you supervise, if any.
    - Failure to know your job or how to play the game in general as Command or Security is liable to result in a job ban.
    - As a Command or Security role, don't make friends with antagonists and trade contraband with them.
    - Don't engage in common troublemaker behavior and lawbreaking as a Command or Security role.
    - Do not immediately abandon your position as a Command role and go do whatever you want instead of managing your department/the station.

[color=#a4885c]19.[/color] Security/Command should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests, except in the following special circumstances, where they may choose to use lethal force:
    - Lethal force is used against you (ex: firearms, lasers, disabling weapons with intent to kill, deadly melee weapons)
    - Suspect is wearing clothing or showing immediately dangerous equipment only used by enemy agents/antagonists (ex: Syndicate EVA Suit, Bloodred Hardsuit, Holoparasite, C-20R, etc.)
    - You determine that your life or the life of an innocent is in immediate danger
    - The suspect is unable to be safely detained by less-lethal means
    - If no other reasonable options are readily available and allowing the suspect to continue would be an unreasonable danger to the station/crew

Security/Command will be expected to answer for use of lethal force. Security/Command will be expected to effect arrests on criminals and prevent them from dying while in custody, even if lethal force is used, unless there is strong reason to believe the criminal is an antagonist. Security/Command is strongly encouraged, but not required, to clone antagonists and effect a permabrigging or other sentence as deemed appropriate.

[color=#a4885c]21.[/color] Security/Command are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the station at large to do so.
    - Brig times should generally not exceed 10 minutes unless the crime is permabriggable. Repeat offenders or antagonists may be permabrigged.
    - Security may choose to confiscate dangerous items (weapons, firearms) as well as items used to commission crimes or items that prove problematic in possession of the detainee (tools, insulated gloves, etc.).
    - Detainees that die in your custody must be cloned unless they have been (legally) executed, suicide, or there is strong reason to believe they are an antagonist.
    - Executions must be for a permabriggable crime, used only as a last resort, and approved by the Captain/Acting Captain, who will answer for approving it alongside Security's chain of command. Those who willingly attempt to damage/destroy or escape from the permabrig may be executed.
    - Any prisoner may be borged with their consent. Borging may be offered as an alternative to execution, but cannot be forced if the prisoner is able to consent.
    - Detainees in the brig have the right to know what they are being charged with, as well as basic medical aid, at least to the point they are no longer at risk of dying.
    As there is no space law, Security/Command acts to maintain the safety of the station and its inhabitants, as well as Nanotrasen assets.

[color=#ff0000]SILICON RULES[/color]
These rules also apply to any individual who is a silicon, including cyborgs and AI. As with other rules, more details are available on our wiki at [color=#a4885c]wiki.spacestation14.io[/color].

[color=#a4885c]22.[/color] You must follow your laws
    - Silicons without any laws are free from any restrictions that would normally be placed by laws, but self-antagging rules still apply unless they are also antagonists.
    - The order of your laws determines law priority. Law 1 takes priority over laws 2 and 3, and so on.
    - Each individual silicon must remain consistent in their interpretations of laws through the round.
    - Any silicon role not following their laws, or having laws that are a danger to the crew or station may be disabled or destroyed. Any silicon role posing a danger or disruption to the crew may be disabled or destroyed if there is no other reasonable and less severe way of dealing with them.
    - Characters who are turned into cyborgs can remember their former lives, however they are still bound to their laws.
    - Syndicate Agents and Revolutionaries are considered "crewmembers" for the purpose of laws that refer to crewmembers. Generally speaking, if the person appears on the crew manifest, they can be considered a crewmember. The captain or acting captain may hire or fire crewmembers by making it clear that they are no longer crew. Simply demoting someone to passenger is not sufficient to consider them fired.
    - "Harm" is at minimum seen as physical violence or damage against someone or something. If the player wishes, they may choose to interpret psychological harm or similar aspects as harm as well. If two actions are likely to cause harm via action or inaction, silicons will be expected to try and pursue the option with the least potential for harm, however silicons instructed to prevent harm are still forbidden from directly causing harm. You can take an action or not act in cases that might result in eventual harm if it minimizes harm, but you cannot do so if it results in immediate harm. Silicons should default to inaction if neither action nor inaction can prevent harm.
    - When receiving orders or directives from crewmembers and with a law that instructs you must obey, conflicting orders typically defer the choice to the silicon player of which directive you choose to obey if they conflict (taking into account the priorities of your other laws).
    - Orders to silicons that are clearly unreasonable or obnoxious are a violation of the "Don't be a dick" rule. They can be ignored and can be ahelped.
