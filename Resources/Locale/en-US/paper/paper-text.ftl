book-text-escalation = When it comes to getting robusted, it's all about strategy. Do it right and you'll be the envy of the station. Do it wrong and the gods themselves may turn against you. Personally, I always aim for the former...

        First things first: let the insults fly! This is your chance to really let your opponent know what you think of their ridiculously large shoes and that annoying bike horn.

        No conflict is complete without a little bit of physicality. Give your opponent a good shove or two, and if you're lucky, they'll stumble and fall, providing even more opportunities for insults.

        But beware, because by now your opponent is probably trying to kill you. So, try to calm things down a bit. It'll make you look good during the inevitable homicide investigation.

        If deescalation doesn't work, it's time to grab a weapon. But be smart about it - choose something that looks like it couldn't possibly be deadly, like this book.

        And if you're both still standing, it's time to pull out the big guns. Find the sharpest thing you can and end things, because everyone's getting kind of tired of this by now.

        Now parade your vanquished opponent through the halls to the medbay so that everyone knows just how robust you really are.

        Remember, it's all about conserving energy. Let your opponent do some of the escalation for you - it's a win-win!

book-text-escalation-security = Get it right and you'll have the whole station calling you shitsec. Get it wrong and you'll face harmbatoning from the gods. Personally, I always aim for the former...

        They say the pen is mightier than the sword, but you don't have a sword, you have a stun baton, and as soon as you start writing, any suspect is going to leave.

        So, try starting your confrontations with words. It probably won't get you called shitsec, but it's also not likely to be very effective against someone with lethal intent.

        Your next move should be to use non-lethal or less lethal devices, like stun batons, disablers, flashes, and flashbangs. Just make sure you get some training on these before trying to use them - offering them to a suspect in exchange for their cooperation is not an effective use of these tools.

        If you're lucky enough to run into a suspect who is a lethal threat, it's time to bust out all the goodies you've been hoarding from the armory.

        For an extra intimidation factor, take your robusted suspects to the medbay to be healed instead of the brig. That way, the whole crew can see just how robust you are.

book-text-atmos-distro = The distribution network, or "distro" for short, is the station's lifeline. It's responsible for transporting air from atmospherics throughout the station.

        Relevant pipes are often painted Popping Subdued Blue, but a surefire way to identify them is to use a tray scanner to trace which pipes are connected to active vents on the station.

        The standard gas mix of the distribution network is 20 degrees celsius, 78% nitrogen, 22% oxygen. You can check this by using a gas analyzer on a distro pipe or any vent connected to it. Special circumstances may call for special mixes.

        When it comes to deciding on a distro pressure, there are a few things to consider. Active vents will regulate the station's pressure, so as long as everything is functioning properly, there's no such thing as too high of a distro pressure.

        A higher distro pressure will allow the distro network to act as a buffer between the gas miners and vents, providing a significant amount of extra air that can be used to re-pressurize the station after a spacing.

        A lower distro pressure will reduce the amount of gas lost in the event that the distro is spaced, a quick way to deal with distro contamination. It can also help slow or prevent over-pressurization of the station in the event of vent issues.

        Common distro pressures are in the range of 300-375 kPa, but other pressures can be used with knowledge of the risks and benefits.

        The pressure of the network is determined by the last pump pumping into it. To prevent bottlenecks, all other pumps between the miners and the last pump should be set to their maximum rate, and any unnecessary devices should be removed.

        You can validate the distro pressure with a gas analyzer, but keep in mind that high demand due to things like spacings can cause the distro to be below the set target pressure for extended periods. So, if you see a dip in pressure, don't panic - it might be temporary.

book-text-atmos-waste = The waste network is the primary system responsible for keeping the air on the station free of contaminants.

        You can identify the relevant pipes by their Pleasing Dull Red color or by using a tray scanner to trace which pipes are connected to the scrubbers on the station.

        The waste network is used to transport waste gasses to either be filtered or spaced. It is ideal to keep the pressure at 0 kPa, but it may sometimes be at a low non-zero pressure while in use.

        Technicians have the option to filter or space the waste gasses. While spacing is faster, filtering allows for the gasses to be reused for recycling or selling.

        The waste network can also be used to diagnose atmospheric issues on the station. High levels of a waste gas may suggest a large leak, while the presence of non-waste gases may indicate a scrubber configuration or physical connection issue. If the gases are at a high temperature, it could indicate a fire.

book-text-atmos-alarms = Air alarms are located throughout stations to allow management and monitoring of the local atmosphere.

            The air alarm interface provides technicians with a list of connected sensors, their readings, and the ability to adjust thresholds. These thresholds are used to determine the alarm condition of the air alarm. Technicians can also use the interface to set target pressures for vents and configure the operating speeds and targeted gases for scrubbers.

            While the interface allows for fine-tuning of the devices under the air alarm's control, there are also several modes available for rapid configuration of the alarm. These modes are automatically switched to when the alarm state changes:
            - Filtering: The default mode
            - Filtering (wide): A filtering mode that modifies the operation of scrubbers to scrub a wider area
            - Fill: Disables scrubbers and sets vents to their maximum pressure
            - Panic: Disables vents and sets scrubbers to siphon

            A multitool can be used to link devices to air alarms.

book-text-atmos-vents =
    Below is a quick reference guide to several atmospheric devices:

            Passive Vents:
            These vents don't require power, they allow gases to flow freely both into and out of the pipe network they are attached to.

            Active Vents:
            These are the most common vents on the station. They have an internal pump, and require power. By default, they will only pump gases out of pipes, and only up to 101 kpa. However, they can be reconfigured using an air alarm. They will also lock out if the room is under 1 kpa, to prevent pumping gasses into space.

            Air Scrubbers:
            These devices allow gases to be removed from the environment and put into the connected pipe network. They can be configured to select specific gases when connected to an air alarm.

            Air Injectors:
            Injectors are similar to active vents, but they have no internal pump and do not require power. They cannot be configured, but they can continue to pump gasses up to much higher pressures.

book-text-botanics = ** Applications of Botanical Specimens Found In Nanotrasen Territories **

      Many plants, when ground, yield useful chemicals. S. (spessmens) papaver and S. aloe vera
      are known for their basic healing properties.

      S. lucidum, or lingzhi, is known for its potent ability to save those near death from toxins. Eating too much
      is known to cause adverse effects.

      S. amanita, a powerfully poisonous specimen (Rest In Peace Sir Alacaster), and S. galactica, a
      seemingly ordinary antitoxin, appear to have some sort of relation to eachother.

      Some research is being done on combinations of the medicinal plants discussed, and they may prove fruitful.

      This station is filled with crime and grime...

      I was shooting hoops down on Bagel when I heard a cry and a laser shot. I walked under the table nearby to hide, but there wasn't a second shot.

      Outside, the engineerin chief got blasted by two Syndies hooked up with some fierce contraband. There wasn't enough of him for an open casket funeral.

      Things always go wild here.. I'll never look at clowns the same.

      The question is.. Who did it?

book-text-ame-scribbles = I don't know if you're trained already, so I hope this'll help.
      AME controller needs LV power and an HV wire to output to. Check the area with a crowbar if you aren't sure.
      There should be an empty room next to where you found this, that room's wired for the AME.
      You can put an AME anywhere if you can get the wires to it, though.
      3x3 grid of AME parts, multitool them to unpack. Be careful not to 'trap' anything.
      AME controller adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) to any point.
      With only 1 core (what a 3x3 grid will get you), don't turn it up above 2.
      The golden rule is 2 injection for every 1 core. You can go lower to save fuel.
      Higher will burn the engine out and eventually make it explode. Don't.
      Don't forget to refuel it, it tends to stop at the worst possible time.
